<h2 class="nobreak" id="ACT_I">ACT I</h2>

<p class="psh1">SCENE.—<i>Living room in</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia Tinker</span>’s <i>home. Exits</i>
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> <i>There is a fireplace</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>front. There should
be a stairway at</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.C.</span>, <i>but it is not absolutely necessary, as
another exit may be used representing exit to up-stairs
rooms. There is a large center table with a lighted lamp
upon it. Old style chairs.</i></p>

<p class="psh2">(<i>As curtain rises</i>, <span class="smcap">Cynthia Tinker</span> <i>stands by the fireplace.
She is removing some vases and pictures from mantel and
packing them into a box which is on the floor near the fireplace.</i>
<span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> <i>is about forty, rather small, bright and energetic.
There is a knock at the door</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Come in and, for the land sakes, shut the door quick!</p>

<p class="psd1"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hepsy Sawyer</span>, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> <i>She is about thirty-five, tall and
wiry. She wears a man’s oil coat and hat.</i></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>as she enters</i>). Well, I should say! (<i>Slams the
door.</i>) Ain’t this a night though?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> It certainly is. Are you crazy, Hepsy? Or is somebody
sick? Whatever on earth brought you out in all this
storm?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> You, Cynthy! (<i>Removes coat and hat.</i>) I thought
I might be able to help you some an’ I couldn’t bear to think
of you alone here on your last night.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>taking hat and coat</i>). That’s more’n kind of you,
Hepsy. There’s a roaring fire in the kitchen stove. I’ll hang
your coat up to dry, and put on some water to make a cup of
tea.</p>

<p class="psd1">(<i>Exit</i>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Hep.</span> <i>walks to fireplace and stands warming her
hands</i>.)</p>

<p class="psdc"><i>Reënter</i> <span class="smcap">Cyn.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> You are really goin’ in the morning, Cynth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>energetically</i>). I really am.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Well, how you can be cheerful about it beats me!
How do you know you’ll like it over to Falmouth and how do
you know as you’ll get along with the people you’re going to
keep house for?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> I don’t know anything about it, Hepsy, but I’ve got
to give it a try. I ain’t got money enough to live on an’ I
can’t set down in this house and starve. I can’t eat the
shingles nor the wall paper. I’m doing the only sensible
thing there is to do.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Trust you to do that, Cynthy. Can I do anything
to help you? Hev you got everything packed?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Yes, all that I’m going to pack. I was just finishing
the last few little things. Cap’n Daniels thinks he can let the
house all furnished.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>explosively</i>). What?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> So that I won’t have to bother to have my things
moved out an’ some—some day (<i>looking around the room with
a sigh</i>), I may be able to come home an’ everything will be
here waiting for me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Cynthia Tinker, do you mean to say that Obed
Daniels has let this place already?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> He thinks so.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>excited</i>). Who to? Do tell, Cynthy!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> I don’t know who it is.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Don’t know? My land! Do you mean that you
didn’t ask him?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> I haven’t seen him yet. He jest sent me a message
by Bennie Hill.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> And you ain’t the slightest idee who it is?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Not the slightest.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> My land! I shan’t sleep a wink to-night. Land
sakes! Who could it be, Cynth? To want a house all furnished?
Why in the land o’ goshen ain’t they got furniture
o’ their own? Must be somebody awful queer coming to
town. Good land, that reminds me! I most forgot to tell
you! Arey Freeman is at home.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Why, what do you mean, Hepsy?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Jest that! She come on the afternoon train. Her
eyes hev give out and the doctor won’t let her study any more
this year an’ she’s come home.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Why, I can’t believe it. Are you sure, Hepsy?
Have you seen her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Oh, yes, I’ve been over. My Sammy told me first
an’ I declare to goodness I didn’t know whether it was the truth
or one of Sammy’s fairy tales. Sometimes I think that young
one will be the death of me an’ Lem before we ever get him
raised. It’s the most wearing thing! He keeps us guessing
all the time. You can’t tell more’n half the time whether he’s
telling the truth or lyin’!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Oh, Hepsy, you shouldn’t speak that way about
Sammy. He’s a dear little fellow and awful good-hearted,
and——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). Now don’t you go to takin’ his part!
He’s all you say maybe but that don’t make it out he can’t tell
the biggest yarns of any young one that walks! And what do
you suppose? His father went into the store the other day
and found him telling one of his tales to the Center Church
minister. Lem like to have swooned. He said he guessed
things had gone jest about far enough and he walked Sammy
home in a hurry, I tell you! And do you know the Rev. Mr.
Peters told Lem he ought not to blame Sammy. Well, Lem
was struck in a heap. “Not blame him fer lyin’?” says Lem.
“He don’t mean it that way,” says Mr. Peters. “The boy
is a wonder. Why, genius just burns in him and he must let
it out. If he keeps on this way you may have a famous writer
in your family some day.” Wal, I declare to goodness, Lem
nearly went crazy. He warmed Sammy plenty that night and
then he set a shingle up on the kitchen mantel and told Sammy
to keep his eye on it, and when he felt genius burning to jest
remember that with his father’s help that shingle could make
things a good deal hotter for him than ever genius thought of
doing. A writer! My land! Lem can’t stand anything
sissy, you know. The Sawyers have always been able-bodied
men, and able to do a day’s work as long as they breathed.
Why, Grandfather Sawyer lived to be a hundred and three,
and weighed two hundred, an’ the day he died he worked six
hours and ate seven pancakes and five hot biscuit for his tea.
That was his last night on this earth.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>dryly</i>). I should thought it might have been.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Hey? What did you say, Cynthy?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>hastily</i>). I—I was—going to ask you about Ariel.
You went over?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Yes, as soon as I made up my mind that Sammy was
telling the truth I started right over and what do you think I
found? Five women there ahead of me! Ain’t that terrible?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
Shouldn’t you think they’d have let her alone, jest gettin’ home
that way, an’ she looked tired to death, though I must say she
is prettier’n ever. An’ I says to her, says I——.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Samuel Sawyer</span> (<i>outside</i>). Maw! Oh, maw! Be you in
Miss Cynthy’s house?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>starting up</i>). Good land! Sammy! What’s he
want? (<i>Going toward door</i>, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>) It’s a pity a body can’t
go calling without bein’ chased up by the family! (<i>Opens
door.</i>) What do you want? No! You’re too wet to come in.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>quickly</i>). No, he isn’t! (<i>Goes to door.</i>) You
come right in, Sammy. I don’t mind a little water. I’ve
lived too close to it all my life to be afraid of it.</p>

<p class="psd1"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sam.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> <i>He is about nine years old, small for his age
and rather delicate looking. He is a decidedly pretty boy
and in decided contrast to either mother or father. He
wears raincoat and hat and rubber boots.</i></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Take your feet right off this floor!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>uncertainly lifting first one foot then the other</i>).
How’ll I do it? Where’ll I put ’em, maw?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>pulling him onto a rug</i>). Stand on a rug! My
land! Did any one ever see sech a young one? What do
you want o’ me?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> A man has stole father’s pipe.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Good land!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>sternly</i>). Now, Samuel Henry, that will do right
now before you go any further!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> ’Tain’t no story, maw. It’s so. I was a-goin’ along
an’——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>warningly</i>). Samuel Henry!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>beginning to whimper</i>). It’s so, maw. I tell you
it’s so!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Gracious, Hepsy, I’d listen to what he says.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Listen to sech foolishness?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> ’Tain’t foolish, maw. Pa’s over to the store, you
know he is.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> (<i>disgusted</i>). Yes, leave it to your pa to hang out at
the store.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> An’—an’—it isn’t pleasant out——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>laughing</i>). No, I guess it ain’t. That’s one truthful
story, Sammy, if you never tell another.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>beginning to grow encouraged</i>). An’—an’—pa forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
his pipe an’ he sent me home for it, an’—I was goin’ along
holdin’ the pipe in my hand—an’—an’—you can’t see a thing
out, the fog’s so thick—an’ a man come right out the fog an’
grabbed the pipe out o’ my hand an’ ran off with it.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>with a gasp</i>). My land!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Samuel Henry, where do you expect to go when you
die?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> It’s so! It is so, maw!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Well, of all the queer——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Hep.</span> Didn’t I tell you? He jest lost that pipe somewhere
and that’s the kind of a story he makes up, and the Rev. Mr.
Peters thinks he is smart.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Well, my land, if he can tell it off as natural as all that
and look as innocent as he does, he sartain is smart. Sammy,
you don’t really mean a man took your father’s pipe away from

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> No, there isn’t. I have thought of everything, but
there is no way. (<span class="smcap">Ber.</span> <i>walks to the fireplace and stands
warming his hands and looking thoughtfully into the fire</i>.) I
love my little home, Cap’n Berry. I was born here in this
house. Mother died here and father and me lived a long time
here together. After father was too old to go fishing he still
had his pension, and with what I could get to do we managed
to pull along, and after he died I managed to get along by myself
though it wasn’t quite so easy. Father called this the
Anchorage, and I never supposed I would have to leave it.
I’ve worked hard to stay, and it doesn’t seem right for me to
have to go.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> You really mean that you don’t think it is right for
you to have to go?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> That’s the way it seems. Father left the home to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and intended I should live here, and it doesn’t seem right to
have to leave.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Then I shouldn’t leave. I should stay right here.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Good land, Cap’n, what do you mean?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Jest what I say! ’Tisn’t a good idee to do a thing
you think it ain’t right to do.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> But land sakes, Cap’n, how could I stay here? I
can’t live on empty air, can I?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, no, not exactly that. I’ll tell you, though I
don’t know as I’ll be very good at finding the right words to
tell you jest what I mean. You say you think it is right for
you to stay here. Now if you really think and believe that,
why—stay! You say this is your home and a way has always
been provided for you to live here. Miss Cynthy, you have
faith in something. All of us have! We all have a Beacon
light we’re steering our course by. Well, jest as long as it’s
been fair weather an’ you had your Beacon plain in sight you
sailed along all serene, but jest the minute the fog shut in you
lost your grip on the steering gear. Miss Cynthy, I reckon the
Keeper of the Beacon expects you to believe that He is there
and the Beacon is shining jest as bright as ever, and when the
fog lifts the rays will be all the brighter to guide you in the
right course.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>astonished and somewhat breathless</i>). But—I don’t
understand exactly. What do you think I ought to do?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Jest keep your faith in the Beacon! Miss Cynthy, if
a ship was trying to make port and the fog was so thick they
couldn’t see my light, I should feel mighty bad if they thought
I was laying down on the job jest because the weather was
rough. No, Miss Cynthy, they know I am there, and the light
is burning, and they jest stop a while until the fog lifts and they
can see their course more clearly. Miss Cynthy, why don’t you
jest stop a while and say with all your might—“this is my
home in foul weather as well as fair. The fog is lifting and the
Keeper of the Beacon is sending me brighter rays to steer my
course”?</p>

although I only saw him a minute and didn’t really see him either.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>sitting by table and beginning to eat</i>). He’s a splendid
man if there ever was one!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Who is with him at the light?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> An old shipmate. They’re doing their own housekeeping,
an’ I must say I’d like to see the inside of a house
run by a couple of men. Cap’n Berry followed the sea for
years, and I have heard tell that he lost his wife and child in a
shipwreck. I don’t believe he’s ever got over it. From something
he said one day I imagine he’s had a pretty sad and lonesome
life, but he certain makes the best of it. He’s invested
in a cranberry bog up the cape, an’ that and his name was
enough to set folks goin’, and he’s pretty generally called Cap’n
Cranberry, but I’m mortified to death to think I should call
him that right to his face.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I don’t believe he cared.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> He wouldn’t let on if he did. My land, Arey, you
ain’t told me a thing about yourself yet. Weren’t it hard to
leave school? Won’t it make a difference when you go back?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> No, I can catch up with my class when I get my
eyes again, and they bothered me so much I was rather glad to
give up the fight and come home. There’s only one thing
bothering me. Father says Nat Williams is expected home any
day.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>sharply</i>). Well, what of it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> You know what of it!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Now see here, Arey, your father has surely got over
that foolishness. As well as he loves you he won’t try to marry
you to a man you don’t love. Didn’t say anything to-day, did
he?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> No, only that Nat is coming and praised him to the
skies, the way he always does. I can’t imagine why he cares
so much for Nat.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>decidedly</i>). Well, you don’t have to even if he does.
I don’t believe your father will start that thing to going again.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>). If he does I had about as soon be
dead. I owe so much to my father, and I want to please him
but I never could make up my mind——(<i>Stops abruptly.</i>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> No, of course you couldn’t. I never was struck on
Nat myself. I can’t imagine what ails your father.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>rising</i>). I must go back. Dad went to the store
and I slipped out. (<i>Takes her coat from chair and puts it on.</i>)
If he goes home and finds me gone such a night as this, he will
sound the fire alarm and get out a searching party. (<i>Kisses</i>
<span class="smcap">Cyn.</span>) Good-night, Miss Cynthy. I—I—oh, I won’t say anything
more to make you feel badly, but I can’t believe there is
anything right about your going away. I’ll see you in the
morning. Good-night. (<i>Opens door</i>, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Good-night, dearie. My land, it grows worse! You

you? I’ve lost my pipe. (<i>Feels in his pocket.</i>) It’s durned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>

I dropped it here.</p>

<p class="psdc">(<i>Begins to look about on the floor.</i>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>joining in search</i>). I haven’t seen it. Are you sure
you had it with you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Sartain! I never travel without it, an’ I declare I’d
about as soon go back home without my head.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Land sakes! You can buy another pipe, can’t you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Yes, but not jest like this one. This pipe came clear
from Calcutta and it sartain is one of my best friends. That
pipe an’ me has faced some black times together and she has
always proved a true comrade in rough weather. Well, I guess
I didn’t drop her here. (<i>Tries to speak carelessly.</i>) Little
gal gone?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Ariel? Yes.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>curiously</i>). Ariel? That ain’t no name for a girl.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Ain’t it? I always thought it was real kind of pretty
and fancy.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Fancy enough, but it’s a boy’s name. How’d she
happen to be called that?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Well, of course Cap’n Freeman didn’t know her real
name and he said Ariel was some spirit of a storm or a tempest
or something, and the name seemed real fitting.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>with an effort</i>). Ain’t—ain’t she Freeman’s own
daughter?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Land, no! Ain’t you never heard nobody tell about
Arey Freeman?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>leaning against the table and gripping the edge with
his hand</i>). No. Where’d she come from?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Abner found her when she was a baby. It was after
a big storm and there’d been a lot o’ shipwrecks and she was
lashed to a spar.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Where was it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Near some foreign port. I forget where. At first he
thought she was probably a foreign baby, but as she grew older
he declared her folks must have been good Yankees. At any
rate he has made a good one of her. (<i>Suddenly noticing him.</i>)

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Yes. Is Cranberry here?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Couldn’t catch him such a night as this if he
hadn’t been gone but a minute.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Dreadful, ain’t it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Couldn’t be much worse. I hear you are leaving
in the morning, Cynthy. Doesn’t seem as if there was any
need of that.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Doesn’t seem so, does it? I have about decided
that it isn’t right.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>sharply</i>). Isn’t right? What do you mean by
that?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Why, this has always been my home and I think
father would want me to stay in it.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Your father? What are you bringing him up for?
He’s dead. You don’t know what he would want.</p>

to-night.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Foolishness always makes me touchy. I suppose
some simpleton has hinted to you that your father was cheated
or something and if you had what was rightfully yours you
wouldn’t have to leave.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Why, Cap’n Abner, have you gone
crazy? No one ever dreamed of such a thing.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> ’Twould be just like them! (<i>Abruptly changes

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Good couple to name together.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> To your way of thinking, perhaps.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>walking toward door</i>). It’s a mighty good way.
(<i>Turns uneasily and comes back.</i>) See here, Cynthy, if you
want me to, I’ll lend you some money to keep you going until
you can get some more work of some kind.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Why, Cap’n Abner, that’s more’n kind of you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> I’d be glad to do it. I was always a good friend
of your father’s. You know that, don’t you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Yes, indeed. Father thought everything of you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, how much do you want?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Not anything. I appreciate your kindness but I
couldn’t do that.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Better do it. I’m perfectly willing.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> No. No, thank you.</p>

I said jest what you told me to, and I put back all the things I
had been packing and made up my mind to stay right here.

to make good or die. Do you understand why I’m so anxious
to make good? Did you understand before—before the smash
came, how much I cared for you? And I dared to hope that
you cared a little, too. Did you, Ariel?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>breathlessly</i>). Oh, you mustn’t talk this way!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> Can’t you give me just a word of hope to encourage
me to work? I will never bother you. I will never ask anything
of you until I prove to you that I am straight. Ariel,
didn’t you care just a little?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>softly</i>). Yes.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee</span> (<i>joyfully</i>). Ariel!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Oh, why did I say that? I have no right to offer
you any encouragement.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee</span> (<i>stepping toward her</i>). Ariel——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Hush! I hear some one coming. (<i>Suddenly.</i>)
Why, Lee, I was so surprised to see you that I never thought.
Have you taken this house? Has Miss Cynthy gone?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> Gone? Of course not! I am boarding with her.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Boarding with Miss Cynthy? Why, you can’t be!
She was going away.</p>

<p class="psdc"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> <i>by stairs</i>.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> Well, here she is to answer for herself.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Oh, it’s you, Arey? I wondered who was talking
down here. Do you know Mr. Gordon?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I have met him before. He went to Yale and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
school is near there, you know. We have met at—at some
social affairs.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>delighted</i>). Well, now, that’s real pleasant, ain’t it?
I have taken another boarder, Mr. Gordon. I hope you don’t
mind.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> Not at all. The more the merrier. Who is it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> I don’t believe I can ever remember what he said.
It’s Peter, I am sure of that much, and he sells clothes sprinklers
for a living.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>amused</i>). What?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee</span> (<i>astounded</i>). Good lord!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Real kind o’ comical, ain’t it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> I should say it was!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>taking up the bottle on the table</i>). Is this one of
them?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Yes, and it works real kind of cute, too.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee</span> (<i>looking at it</i>). Good-night! Oh, Miss Tinker, I got
my car up here and I was going to ask you if it would be all
right to run it into this little house out back here?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Why, yes, if it’s big enough.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> Just about right, I think. Thank you. I will see
you later, Miss Freeman.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Good-morning, Mr. Gordon. (<span class="smcap">Lee</span> <i>exits</i>, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>
<span class="smcap">Ariel</span> <i>goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> <i>and throws her arms around her</i>.) Oh,
Miss Cynthy, you aren’t going after all! Wasn’t it dreadful
sudden, your taking Mr. Gordon?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Well, it was rather unexpected. He was hunting
around in the fog last night for a place to stay, and he came
here, and after he got here he didn’t want to leave.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Wasn’t that wonderful?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>with a curious smile</i>). Yes, I think it was kind of.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I’m so glad. I never needed you so much in my
life as I do now.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Nat Williams came home last night. It—it seems
that before he sailed this last time father about the same as
promised him that I would marry him after I graduate.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Arey, what are you talking about?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> What am I going to do?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> As you please, of course. Your father is crazy.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> It’s so hard. I want to please father and there
isn’t a thing in the world against Nat. He is a good man and
doing well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> There’s lots of good men doing well in this world,
but that don’t make it out you got to marry them all.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I just can’t make up my mind to marry Nat.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Of course you can’t. (<i>Decidedly.</i>) You are too
young to marry any one.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Why, lots of girls younger than I am marry.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Well, because some folks is foolish——(<i>Suddenly
stops and looks at her.</i>) Land o’ goshen, Arey, there ain’t
some one you want to marry, is there?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>faintly</i>). I didn’t say so.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Who is it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> No one in Bay Point, Miss Cynthy. And it can’t
ever come to anything. He is just the kind that father wouldn’t
approve of.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> I never knew it to fail.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> And I’m so unhappy. (<i>Begins to cry.</i>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>dryly</i>). Of course! Dyin’ of a broken heart!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>). Why, Miss Cynthy!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>going to her and putting her arms around her</i>).
There, child, you know I’m sorry for you. Only you’re so
young, it seems so kind of foolish for you to be talking about
marrying any one.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I haven’t got any mother—and—and—(<span class="smcap">Ber.</span> <i>enters</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, <i>unnoticed</i>) dad’s going against me, and—if—if—you don’t
stand by me I’ll die!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> There, child——(<i>Suddenly notices</i> <span class="smcap">Ber.</span>, <i>who is
trying to make a quiet exit.</i>) Oh, it’s you, Cap’n?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>springing to her feet</i>). Oh!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> It’s Cap’n Berry!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>trying to choke back her tears</i>). Good-morning.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Go in my room, dearie. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Ariel</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, <i>hastily</i>.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>awkwardly</i>). I’m sorry I happened——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> That’s all right, Cap’n. I guess you think women
folks are always crying.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> That’s their privilege and safety valve. There’s times
when the men would like durned well to cry, but they swear
instead. Wha-what did she mean about her—her father’s
going against her?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Oh, she didn’t just realize what she was saying. I
don’t believe Abner would ever really go against her. He
worships the ground she walks on, but he is acting queer all
of a sudden.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> What’s the trouble? Of course ’tain’t none of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
business, but sometimes an outsider can help, unexpected like,
you know.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> I’m afraid no outsider can help in this. It looks like
some trouble between Arey and Abner. He’s set on her marrying
Nat Williams.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Cap’n Williams that sails for Howland Gordon o’
Boston?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, he’s said to be a likely sort o’ chap, ain’t he?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Oh, yes, but you don’t believe in a girl’s being forced
to marry a man she doesn’t care for, do you, even if he is a
likely sort of chap?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Is Cap’n Abner forcing her?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> I don’t know as he is exactly, but he’s terrible set on
it, an’ I don’t see why. He’s had two spells before this of
trying to induce her to say “yes” to Nat. It’s terrible queer.
He tries to make her feel that she owes everything, even her
life, to him, and it’s her duty to obey.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>frowning</i>). Oh, he does, eh? Then she knows she
ain’t really Freeman’s daughter?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Oh, yes, she knows it, but she doesn’t realize the difference.
She wasn’t more’n a year old when he found her.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Never had no clues as to whom her own folks was?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> No, I guess not, although I think I’ve heard tell he
has some things that were on her, a locket or something, I don’t
remember what. He’s been a good father to her all these
years. I can’t imagine what ails him now. Well, there’s lots
o’ queer things in this world, and lots of unhappiness. (<i>Suddenly.</i>)
Well, if I’m going to get dinner for—land, Cap’n
Berry, I forgot to tell you. I’ve taken another boarder.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, you are rushing things, ain’t you? Say, Miss
Tinker, do you know anything about the young chap you took
in last night?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> No, not a thing!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Seems a good sort of fellow?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> He certain does. He’s got a real taking way with
him. (<i>Alarmed.</i>) What’s the matter, Cap’n Berry?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, of course there was considerable excitement in
town last night, and of course a stranger always causes a lot of
talk, and his coming mysterious like——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). There wasn’t nothing mysterious
about it fur’s I can see.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, some people look at it different, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Hepsy Sawyer. That woman’s got a northeast gale blowing
off the end of her tongue fresh every hour. Anyway they’ve
got it going that this chap you’ve took in may be concerned,
and I expect you will have the whole crowd down here in a few
minutes.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> My land, Cap’n Berry, that boy never had nothin’
ter do with it in this world. He is as innocent as—as—as a little
ba-a lamb. Cap’n Berry, you don’t believe that I did wrong
in taking him in? You know you—you——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Yes, I know, and I think you done jest right. I know
you wouldn’t have taken a stranger in if it hadn’t been for what
I said, and don’t you worry a mite, Miss Cynthy, no matter
what any one says, I will stand by you. Where is your boarder?
I’d like to have a look at him.</p>

<p class="ptx1 p0b"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> He’s out in the back yard trying to get his car into
father’s old carpenter shed. Come out and see him.</p>

Have you heard the excitement in town this morning?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Seven pipes were stolen last night.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> Seven? Why, you said three.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> I said I took three.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee</span> (<i>puzzled</i>). Well—but——(<i>Staggered</i>.) You don’t
mean to say some one else look the other four?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter</span> (<i>looking surprised</i>). Why, I supposed you were the
some one else!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> Well, you have another think. I know absolutely
nothing about it. I left that part of the job to you, and why—great
heavens, Pete! Seven pipes? Just the number we
planned on taking!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Exactly. That’s why I thought you had a hand
in it.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> But what do you make of it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> I don’t make. We wanted a mystery. We’ve got
it! The sooner we get to work the better.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>rushing forward and taking her hand</i>). Ariel! I
have been chasing all over Bay Point after you. Hepsy said
she thought you came down here. I couldn’t wait to see you
again.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>with an effort</i>). How do you do, Nat?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I couldn’t realize my good luck when I heard you
were at home, although of course I am sorry about your eyes.
I wish you would tell me that you are glad to see me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Why, of course I am always glad to see old friends.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> That is too impersonal. I want you to say you are
glad to see me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> You are somewhat exacting, aren’t you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Ariel, don’t talk to me that way. I can’t stand it.
You know how much I care, and you must try to care, too.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Must?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> You understand what I mean.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> We have several times, and we are going over it again

dreaming that I was coming straight to you. I thought I should
have to wait until summer before I saw you again. Now that
I haven’t got to wait I don’t intend to lose one minute.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Will you, indeed? Do you expect to do
it by yourself? I guess you will have to call for help.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Your father will give me all the help I need.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> This is something he cares nothing about.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Oh, never mind about it. Don’t trouble yourself,
father. I can imagine what you said, and I can be just exactly
as happy if I don’t hear it.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Ariel, I don’t want you to go to acting this way with
Nat. You just make him mad, and I don’t wonder. Sometimes
you are enough to make St. Peter swear. Nat wants to
marry you, not now, but when you graduate. I don’t see any
earthly reason why you shouldn’t promise to. Nat’s a fine fellow
and doing well. You haven’t anything against him?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Certainly not, but I don’t care to promise myself to
any one. Graduation is quite a long ways off yet.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Ariel, I don’t very often ask anything of you. I
don’t remember that I have ever asked any very special thing.
Don’t you think it’s your duty to do this first thing that I ask?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Oh, dad, how can you make such a request in such
a way? (<i>Bursts into tears and runs out</i>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, Nat, this looks mighty foolish to me. If a
girl won’t, she won’t.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Do you intend to let her do as she pleases?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Let her? Good lord, do you expect me to force
her into a marriage with you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Don’t you feel that you owe me some recompense?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, great heaven, won’t anything but Ariel satisfy
you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> No.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Well, I must say you——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>quietly</i>). Captain Freeman, what were you doing in
the post-office last night?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>starting</i>). In the post-office?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>pointedly</i>). Yes, long after it closed?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>growing angry</i>). What do you mean?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Just what I say. I know you were there. There is
no use in denying it.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>beside himself</i>). Why, you—do you mean to insinuate——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>calmly</i>). Just explain your presence there. (<i>Slight
pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Abner</span> <i>remains silent</i>.) You didn’t find what you
were looking for, did you? I was before you, Captain Freeman.
Before I sailed this last time, I made a midnight visit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the post-office myself, but I covered my tracks. I think something
must have scared you off before you had a chance to pick
things up.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> You dare to tell me that you entered the post-office?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Oh, yes, you won’t say anything about it. If you
did I should be obliged to show the papers I went after, and
you wouldn’t have any one see those papers for a farm.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>desperately</i>). I don’t know what you are driving
at.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Oh, yes, you do. See here, Captain Freeman, all in
this world I want is your influence with Ariel. This is a mean
way to get it, I’ll admit, but I want the girl and I don’t care
how I get her.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> And if I refuse to bother Ariel any more what is it
you are threatening?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Why, I don’t know as I have exactly threatened anything.
Threatened isn’t a nice word. Of course you know
that you owe as much to Miss Tinker as you did to my father.
I don’t know exactly how you would come out if the thing was
to go to court, but as long as Miss Cynthy is in need of money
it looks to me like a question of honor on your part. I understand
she is about to leave town to look for work.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>snapping the words out</i>). She isn’t going! (<i>Beside
himself again.</i>) If you think you can frighten me you are
mistaken! I absolutely deny that I was inside the post-office
last night.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Oh, well, of course if you are going to take that
stand I shall——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> Hepsy! Will you hush up? I don’t mean that fellow

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Who says he was prowling?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> I say so. Prowling around——</p>

enough for us folks that lives here all the time.</p>

what he was doing. (<i>Importantly.</i>) In fact we got to inquire
into everybody’s business that was out last night. It ain’t so
much those durned pipes, though it certainly beats tunket who
took them, but the post-office was broken into, you must remember,

<p class="psd1">SCENE.—<i>A room in</i> <span class="smcap">Abner’s</span> <i>old fish-house, supposed to be
on the shore. There is one exit</i>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>An old-fashioned
bureau</i>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>A doll’s house. Some rag rugs on the floor.
Some old chairs. An old lounge</i>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, <i>front. A hammock.
On a stage where it is possible there should be a large door
in the center with a view of the water beyond. An impression
of the room being up-stairs would add to the scene</i>.</p>

<p class="psdc">(<i>As the curtain rises</i>, <span class="smcap">Sam.</span> <i>stands by the exit listening</i>.)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>outside</i>). Come up-stairs, Nat! (<span class="smcap">Sam.</span> <i>gives a
frightened look around the room and crawls under the sofa</i>.
<span class="smcap">Nat</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Abner</span> <i>enter</i>.) This is a good place to talk things
over. Hardly any one but Arey ever comes up here. (<i>If
there is a door</i> <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, <i>he throws it open</i>.) There’s a fine view from
here. On a clear day you can see way down to High Land.
This used to be Arey’s playhouse.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>looking about</i>). Well I know that. We boys used to
come up here to tease the girls because the cake that went with
the tea parties appealed to us. It was here I fell in love with
Arey. It was here I first asked her to marry me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> I’m sorry, Nat, that Arey doesn’t care for you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> It’s plain to see now why she doesn’t care.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> No nonsense about it. Look at the way she took the
part of that darned little sand peep. Well, I’ll make her see
what he is before I get through.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> You are crazy jealous, Nat. Don’t make a fool
of yourself. Ariel is good-hearted and impulsive, and quick to
take the part of any one who is in trouble.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> She wouldn’t help me if I was dying.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). Well, perhaps she wouldn’t! Might
as well say one thing as another. It’s a waste of time and
energy to argue with a man who is madly in love and insanely
jealous.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Are you going to let her take up with this little crook
and throw me over?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Crook is a strong word, Nat. The boy may have
been expelled from college, and may be in wrong with his
father, but he didn’t break into the post-office last night. I
think it is more than likely that he called there in his efforts to
find a boarding place. I was scared off by some one’s knocking
on the door.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>with an exclamation of satisfaction</i>). Ah! Then
you admit that you were the one who entered the post-office?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Certainly. I don’t know how I am going to pull
out, but I can’t let this fellow face a charge of which I am
guilty. How did you know I was there?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> After we had our little talk last night, I guessed you
would go there and I followed you. I thought you might be
interested in looking over Cap’n Obed’s old papers.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Yes, I was. Well, now we will face the situation.
I have several times offered you money which you have refused
to take.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I’m not interested in money. I’m doing well enough.
You know what I want.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Yes, I do know. You want me to actually force
my daughter into marrying you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Well, why not? You admit I am all right. There
is no reason why she wouldn’t be happy with me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> And in case I refuse, just what are you going
to do?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Well, of course I don’t suppose you want all your old
friends and neighbors to know how you cheated my father and
old Joel Tinker, and of course now there is Miss Cynthy.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, I can’t see any way of giving her money
without telling the whole thing.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> The land this building stands on is hers, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> I’m not saying just what belongs to her. (<i>Suddenly
and determinedly.</i>) See here, Nat, if you can show me
a way out of the hole I am in, I will see what I can do with
Arey.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> That sounds like sense. Get Ariel to give me her
promise and I’ll hand over the papers I stole from Obed’s safe
last winter, and you will never hear another word from me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, what about last night? I was a tarnation
fool.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> I’ll take the responsibility of it. I’ll say that I did
it. I’ll hatch up an excuse of some kind. I don’t suppose
you really made away with anything? (<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> It isn’t at all likely. Obed will find all his stuff after
a while. I couldn’t very well speak up and tell him where I
put the money box.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Well, if he doesn’t find it, you can tell me, and I will
tell them where it is when I get around to a confession.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, that will pull young Gordon out of the post-office
business, but it doesn’t make it out he didn’t steal about
six pipes. Mine is accounted for.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Oh, Gordon is up to something. That’s the kind of
a little snipe he is. His father has nothing but trouble with
him. How soon will you see Arey?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Right off. I don’t see that we have provided any
way to straighten things out with Miss Cynthy.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Nat</span> (<i>easily</i>). Well, she has managed to pull along all these
years. Why fret now? What she doesn’t know isn’t going to
hurt her.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> (<i>outside</i>). Cap’n Abner, are you up there?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>going to door</i>). Yes.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Well, for the love o’ Admiral Dewey, listen to
this! (<i>Enters, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Lem.</span>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> Say, Obed has discovered that there weren’t nothin’
took from the post-office last night.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Gosh all fog horns, no! I found the money box!
Not a cent gone! Everything upset from one end the place to
the other, and nothing took! That young Gordon chap must
be a lunatic. Cranberry has gone his bail, but I reckon he
ought ter be in an asylum instead o’ traveling around loose.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> Wal, it’s the durndest piece o’ business I ever heard
tell on, and everybody don’t believe he took all those pipes
even if there is so much evidence against him. Some says it
was a big fellow and some says it was a little one.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> I stick to it the man that stole my pipe wuz a little
bit of a feller. He up behind me and put his hand in my
pocket (<i>illustrating as he talks</i>) an’ scat before you could so
much as wink.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> Yes, an’ Jim Hincks says he wuz a big feller.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> And Sammy said so once, and then he shied off
and wouldn’t say much of anything.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> No wonder. The way Lem talks at the kid is
enough to frighten a whale.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> An’ Cranberry didn’ know when his pipe was took
and wouldn’t say nothin’ if he did. He’s took an awful shine
to Miss Cynthy’s boarder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Say, suppose we find the feller and tell him we
found out he didn’t take nothin’ from the post-office an’ see
what he says.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">All.</span> That’s right. Good idee!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> Maybe he’ll own up ’bout the pipes if he finds out
the charge agin him ain’t so serious.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Maybe so, but it’s my opinion the feller is plumb
crazy.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Why, certainly, if you like. (<span class="smcap">Ber.</span> <i>enters</i>.) This

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Nonsense! That’s a pretty way for a young girl like

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I wish I didn’t have. I wish this was the last day
of my life.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>aghast</i>). Miss Freeman, you don’t know what you
are saying. Something must have happened to pretty much
upset you. You don’t look like a coward. I can’t somehow
believe you are one.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>surprised</i>). A coward?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> It’s only a coward, a pretty contemptible one at that,
who would rather die than face what’s coming to him.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>suddenly standing straight and throwing her head
up</i>). You are right. I didn’t think of that. Thank you,
Captain Berry. That was just what I needed to hear. You—you
spend a good deal of time over here in town, don’t you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Is that a reflection on my duties as keeper
of Bay Point Light?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>hastily</i>). Oh, no, no, no! I didn’t mean that. I
was just thinking that you must like our town. I know you
have an assistant, and any one doesn’t have to meet you but
once to realize that your duty would stand before anything else
in the world.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>pleased and touched</i>). Why, Miss Freeman, I thank
you for that from the bottom of my heart. You can’t understand
how much I appreciate that coming from you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Why from me, especially? Oh!</p>

<p class="psdc">(<i>Drops the little box and a little ring.</i>)</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>picking them up and looking at the ring fascinated</i>).
What is this?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>slowly</i>). That—that is a link, Captain Berry. The
only connecting link between Ariel Freeman and the girl she
really is.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>breathing hard</i>). What do you mean?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I suppose you know I’m not Captain Freeman’s
daughter? Everybody knows.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Yes, I’ve heard.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> That little ring is the only thing which could throw
any light on who I really am. That was on my finger, and
that was absolutely all there was to help.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> How did this help?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> There is a name engraved inside the ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>slowly</i>). And the name is Alicia.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Why, who told you that?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>realising what he has said</i>). Why—why—it’s right
here! (<i>Hastily examines the ring.</i>) You can see it for yourself!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> You have wonderful eyes. I have always known
what the name is, and I have hard work to trace it. You see
what a curious little old-fashioned ring it is; it has a German
mark in it. Captain Freeman traced this to a German jeweler
who in 1878 engraved the name Alicia in a baby ring for a
Mrs. Emerson. The address was a hotel in Berlin. Father
moved heaven and earth to trace it still further, but that was
all he ever found out. He decided that my mother must have
been Alicia Emerson, but whom she married, who my father is,
will probably always remain unknown. Somewhere in the world
I may have a mother—a father.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> You have been happy here?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Oh, yes, indeed. I couldn’t have had a kinder
father than Captain Freeman. Gracious, Captain Berry, I
can’t imagine why I have told you all these things! I never
speak of them to any one but Miss Cynthy. Somehow you
seem to be the kind of man one tells their innermost secrets to.
It was so kind of you to help Lee Gordon this morning.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Nonsense! Nothing kind about it. Justice, that’s
all. He ain’t any more guilty than I am.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> You really think so?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Certain! One look at his face will tell you that.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> But the evidence against him? Such a lot of it!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> By tunket, the circumstantial kind or I’ll eat my hat.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> Why, Captain Berry (<i>suddenly grabbing pipe from
hammock</i>), look! Here’s a pipe in my hammock! What in
the world——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>taking pipe</i>). Jumping jingoes! Seth Mason’s!
Got his name on it!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> I thought some one was up here just before you
came up. It seemed to me that some one who was small was
moving around. I was over by the bureau and I can’t see
across the room, you know. I was startled for a second and by
the time I got my senses together to cross the room they were
gone.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Um! So? (<i>Looks about. Crosses room away
from</i> <span class="smcap">Ariel</span>. <i>He suddenly stoops and looks under sofa.</i>)
This is a queer mix up, ain’t it? (<i>Bell rings.</i>) What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel.</span> That’s the house bell. Dad had it connected so
we could hear it when we were over here and Hannah was out.
I think she is out now, I will just run over to the house if you
will excuse me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Certain! (<span class="smcap">Ariel</span> <i>exits</i>. <span class="smcap">Ber.</span> <i>goes to sofa</i>.) Come
out! Come out here, I say! It’s no use, Sammy! I have
caught you square! You might as well come out! All right
then! I’ll bring you out myself. (<i>Reaches under sofa and
pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Sam.</span> <i>out by one foot</i>. <span class="smcap">Sam.</span> <i>yells and kicks</i>.) Belay
there! That ain’t no way to act with your old uncle. I ain’t
going to hurt you. (<i>Sits down on sofa and holds</i> <span class="smcap">Sam.</span> <i>in his
arms</i>.) Now hush up, and tell Uncle Cran the whole business.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>struggling to get away</i>). No! I ain’t got nothin’ to
tell!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Oh, yes, you have, Sammy! Sit still! You tell
Uncle Cran what you stole all those pipes for. I was the only
one in the room that was watching you this morning, and I
guessed somewheres near the truth. You were frightened when
that pipe fell out of Mr. Gordon’s pocket, and then when you
found that no one was going to suspect you, you opened up the
sugar-bowl and took the other one out, and now you just
brought this one up here and put it in Arey’s hammock.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>thoroughly frightened</i>). Pa will kill me!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> No, he won’t. Now listen, Sammy, this whole thing
has got to come out some way. Your father will get it out of
you, and you know how he will get it. Now, you tell me the
truth and I’ll promise you that I will make things right with
your father. I won’t let him touch you. You can trust me,
can’t you?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>holding him around the neck</i>). Yes, Uncle Cran.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, then, when did you get a chance to go up into
Mr. Gordon’s room and leave those three pipes there?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> I didn’t take those.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>). Now, Sammy, I said if you told me
the truth.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> That’s the truth, Uncle Cran! I took this pipe, and
the one in the sugar-bowl and the one in Mr. Gordon’s pocket,
but I didn’t take the others.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> By Crismus, you look as if you were telling a straight
story. Why in the name o’ all that’s sensible did you steal any
of the pipes?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> Well, a man took dad’s away from me, an’ maw
didn’t believe it and I knew there wouldn’t any one believe it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and pa whales the stuffins out of me for telling things and—and—I
thought if some more people lost their pipes he’d believe
me. So I stole three and—and—pa had to believe me.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>striking his knee</i>). Well, by tunket, if that ain’t one
on Lem! (<i>Suddenly looks serious and speaks half to himself.</i>)
But belay there, Cranberry! You ain’t got but half the story
yet! There’s those other pipes! Well, Sammy, I’ll pull you
out of this some way, although I don’t know as it’s the right
thing for me to do.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>stretching</i>). Oh, I’m awful tired! I been layin’ under
this sofa awful long. More’n an hour, more’n three hours,
I guess. Nat Williams was up here an’ Cap’n Abner. Say,
Uncle Cran, it was Cap’n Abner that broke into the post-office
last night.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>at the top of his voice</i>). What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> He was hunting for a paper. And—and—Cap’n
Abner cheated Miss Cynthy. Nat said the land this house
stands on belongs to her, and—and—Cap’n Abner cheated
Nat’s father, too,—and—and—Cap’n Abner is going to make
Miss Arey marry Nat—and—and—she cried over there (<i>pointing
to bureau</i>) on top of her doll—and—and—I guess I don’t
remember any more.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, that’s quite sufficient if it’s truth you are telling.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> Of course it is! I wouldn’t tell you any stories,
Uncle Cran.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>a trifle dazed</i>). All right. Now listen, Sammy, you
forget this stuff you have been telling me jest as soon as ever
you can. Don’t you breathe a word of it to a living soul. If
I ever hear that you have, I’ll forget to make peace with your
father, and there won’t be any more trips with me over to the
Point to visit the light.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> Oh, I’ll never tell, Uncle Cran! Honest! Hope
to die!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> All right. Now you go and find Cap’n Abner and
tell him that I am up here and want to see him. Then you go
home as hard as you can pelt. Your mother is looking for
you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Sam.</span> (<i>exits</i>). All right, Uncle Cran.</p>

When I was at Yale I was connected with a college magazine
and I have several times been told that I had a great future
ahead of me as a newspaper man or magazine editor. My
friend Pomeroy here had to leave college last year because an
invalid uncle who had brought him up was dying. The uncle
left Pete all his money and when I got into a mess with dad,
Pete suggested that he buy a magazine he had heard about
that was on its last legs and see if we could give it a brace. I
jumped at the chance. It was what I would most like on
earth. Pete bought it and we have started to publish and edit
a startling fiction magazine called <i>The Red Cap</i>. For a
starter we have announced a serial detective story—“The
Mystery of the Seven Pipes.”</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, by tunket!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> It’s going to be the greatest thing on record. We
write all but the last chapter and offer a prize for the best solution
of the mystery. Gee! Folks run after the first issue as
if it was soothing syrup and they had a kid with the colic. I
had been down on the Cape, so I suggested that we lay the
scene down here somewhere.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee.</span> And to give local color I suggested that we come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
down and carry out some of the story ourselves. Last night
when we arrived there was a thick fog and it seemed a good
chance to make a start. We drew lots and it fell to Pete to
steal the pipes.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> We planned on stealing seven but I only got as far
as three.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee</span> (<i>laughing</i>). For the love of Pete, have you any idea
who took the other four?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Yes, by tunket, I have! This beats the Dutch and
no mistake! You go find Obed and Lem and tell them what
you have told me. Then you bring them back here and we
will clear up the mystery.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lee</span> (<i>jumping up</i>). Done, by jingo!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Did you send Sammy after me?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Yes, I did. I’ve got something to say to you and I
thought this would be a good place up here. Cap’n Freeman,
I’m Ariel’s father.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>staggered</i>). What? What do you mean? (<i>Suddenly
growing furious.</i>) What kind of a trick is this? Do
you expect me to take your word for it? What’s your game?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>calmly</i>). I married Alicia Emerson twenty years ago
this month. Two years later she and our year old daughter
made a trip with me. We ran into a storm and were wrecked.
My wife’s body was recovered. The child’s was not. I supposed
her dead, of course. She wore a ring, a ring that had
been her mother’s. It had her name, Alicia, engraved in it,
also the mark of a German jeweler and——</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>hoarsely</i>). Enough! How long have you known
this?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> I guessed it last night when I saw Alicia’s face in
your daughter. I made sure of the truth this afternoon.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, what are you going to do? She is under
age. The law would give her to you, I suppose. Are you
going to take her away from me after all these years?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> You love her?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> How can you ask such a question? She is all I
have! Ask any one in Bay Point. Ask the girl herself!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>quietly</i>). And yet loving her you ask her to marry a
man she doesn’t love. Kind of curious, ain’t it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>decidedly</i>). It’s mine, also. She is my daughter. If
you will not give the girl happiness, I will take her from you

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>hastily</i>). No. Supposing I refuse?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, it will be my gain. I shall be able to find a
little happiness with my daughter. I only had her a year. I
only had her mother two years. Then they were both taken
from me at the same time. I’ve had a lonely life, always at
sea or keeping a light on some dismal point. Often when the
gales have come and the storms have lashed around the old
house and there’s been nobody but jest old Cranberry and his
pipe, I have looked around my lonely settin’ room and wondered
how it would seem to have Alicia on the other side of
the fire and a little girl on the floor near by.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> My heaven, Berry, I hadn’t thought of your part
of this!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> No, we usually get our own point of view. Mighty
seldom we get the other fellow’s.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> And if—if I agree you are willing to swear you
will not take the girl?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> On my word of honor. You do love the girl after all.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> But great heaven man, I can’t square things with
Cynthy Tinker without having people know the facts. Nat
will tell.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Why don’t you do the telling yourself? If you have
been cheating perfectly innocent people I think you will find
that confession is a good thing for a guilty conscience. Anyway
you have two paths to choose from, and you know what is
at the end of each.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Yes, they rejoice in all the horrible details.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Gosh all fog horns I should say we did! Did any
one ever hear the like? A story! “Mystery of the Seven
Pipes!”</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> I always said writers wuz half cracked. I never was
so sure of it as I am this minit! But the mystery ain’t all
cleared by a long sight. Mr. Pomeroy only took three pipes.
Who took the other four?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> I suppose, Lem, as constable of Bay Point, you would
like to have the mystery cleared up?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> I sartain would, and then I could go back to work at
something sensible.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, I’ll tell you what you want to know if you’ll
jest do me a little favor.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> (<i>puzzled</i>). Why, sartain, Cap’n, always glad to do
anythin’ fer you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Well, Sammy took three pipes.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">All.</span> Sammy?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> My Sammy?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Gosh all fog horns!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Mr. Pomeroy stole yours from Sammy. You wouldn’t
believe the boy, he was afraid of you and he took some pipes
on his own hook to make his story sound true.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Rev. Mr. Peters said he was smart and by Crismus,
he is! He’s too smart fer you, Lem!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> Wal, he’ll find out how smart I am when I get home.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> Lem, you promised me a little favor, you know?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> Sure!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> You are not to touch Sammy.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> (<i>astonished</i>). I’m not to—— (<i>Suddenly stops and
grins.</i>) Well, all right. You’ve got me, Cap’n. You always
did spoil that kid. Wal, there’s still another pipe.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Yes, mine. I dropped it when I broke into the
post-office last night.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">All.</span> What? You? Abner!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Fer the love o’ Admiral Sampson what fer?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner</span> (<i>steadily</i>). I wanted to find some old papers in a
business deal between your father and me. I suppose you
remember that your father sold me this whole shore property
here?</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> Yes, sartain.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Well, I found out right after I bought it that half
the land didn’t belong to him to sell. There was a mistake in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
his title and some of the land belonged to Nat’s father and
some of it belonged to Miss Cynthy’s father.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Land o’ goshen!</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> They didn’t seem to know. They must have
thought old Mr. Daniels knew what was his property. I
didn’t say anything. You know why I wanted the property
and the money I have made here. I knew if they realized this
land was theirs they wouldn’t have sold. They would have
used it themselves. I knew I had a good thing and I kept it.
I made a pile and I kept them from their chance of making
money when shore property was worth its weight in gold. That
day has long gone by, but I’m ready to pay Miss Cynthy whatever
seems right. I’ll leave it to Cap’n Cranberry to figure it
out. I have offered money to Nat and he has refused to take
it. He wants my daughter instead. Well, he had better take
my money, for he can’t have my daughter unless she wants him.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ariel</span> (<i>joyfully</i>). Father!</p>

years. Of course I realize that I’ve got to lose my friends,
that I will be the talk of the town.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> I don’t see why. It’s taken a pile of courage to come
out and say you were wrong and make it right. If your neighbors
are good friends they will stand by you. They won’t go
back on you.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Obad.</span> That’s right, Abner. Of course we won’t.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Lem.</span> And there ain’t a mite of reason why any one should
know anything about this. I for one shan’t mention it to
Hepsy, and (<i>grimly</i>) I guess if she don’t know it you’re safe.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> (<i>earnestly</i>). And I ain’t got the least bit of feeling

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Abner.</span> Thank you, Cynthy. Thank you all. I don’t
deserve such treatment from you.</p>

coming into money I hope you won’t be so set up that you’ll
bounce your boarders.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Cyn.</span> Well, I guess it won’t be such an awful lot o’ money
that I need to be set up too high. I said you could stay as long

Listen, you who heard Mr. Williams denounce Lee this morning.
The fellow who was guilty in the Yale mix up has been

Cap’n Berry, I didn’t suppose you ever got to feeling like this.
I think you must have lost sight of the Beacon.</p>

<p class="ptx1"><span class="smcap">Ber.</span> (<i>suddenly looking up</i>). By tunket, Miss Cynthy,
you’re right! That’s jest what I’ve done! I reckon I’m kind

thinking there weren’t nobody on earth that loves me, and by
Crismus, why should there be? I ain’t got relations same’s
other men and I ain’t got no right to expect the same kind of
happiness as other men. Well, I’ll set sail for the Point and

too much time over here and I need to go to work.</p>

around like a sixteen-year-old kid! The first day I met you I
loved you and I have been loving you a little more every time
I have seen you since. I wouldn’t want you to marry unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
it meant the same to you as it does to me, and I can’t believe
that’s possible. I reckon I know what you’re thinking. I

have it from you straight. (<i>Goes to her, and puts his hands

even the Red Cross Workers, all asking her to be their Queen, but it is
only when the Soldiers and the Red Cross Nurses come, asking nothing
and giving all, that she yields. Easy, pretty, timely, and strongly recommended.

<p class="pls1">A Play in One Act</p>

<p class="pls2">By Mary Moncure Parker</p>

<p class="pld">Twelve females. Costumes of 1890 with one exception; scene, a single
easy interior. Plays thirty minutes. Describes the trials of an ambitious
woman who desired to form a club in the early days of club life for
women about thirty years ago, before the days of telephones and automobiles.
A capital play for ladies’ clubs or for older women in general.
The costumes are quaint and the picture of life in the year of the Chicago
World’s Fair offers an amusing contrast to the present. Recommended.</p>

<p class="plt">HAMILTON</p>
</div>

<p class="pls1">A Play in Four Acts</p>

<p class="pls2">By Mary P. Hamlin and George Arliss</p>

<p class="pld">Eleven males, five females. Costumes of the period; scenery, three
interiors. Plays a full evening. Royalty for amateur performance where
an admission is charged, $25.00 for each performance. Special royalty of
$10.00 for performance by schools. This play, well known through the
performances of Mr. George Arliss still continuing in the principal theatres,
presents the builders of the foundations of the American Republic as real
people, and its story adroitly illustrates not merely the various ability of
its leading figure, Alexander Hamilton, but the unconquerable courage
and determination that were his dominating characteristics. The vividness
with which it vitalizes the history of its period and the power with
which it emphasizes Hamilton’s most admirable and desirable quality,
make it most suitable for school use, for which special terms have been
arranged, as above. Strongly recommended.</p>

<p class="pls1">A Patriotic Sketch for Girls of the High School Age in a
Prologue and Three Episodes</p>

<p class="pls2">By Nellie S. Messer</p>

<p class="pld">Thirteen girls. Costumes, modern, Colonial and of the Civil War
period. Scenery, three interiors. Plays an hour and a half. Betty and
Eleanor, typically thoughtless girls of the present day, run across the
diaries of Bess’s mother and grandmother, which relate the experiences of
girls of their age and kind at previous periods of their country’s history,
and learn a vivid lesson in patriotism. The scenes of the past are shown
in dramatic episodes visualizing the matter of the diaries that they read.
A very clever arrangement of a very stimulating subject, strongly recommended
for all occasions where the promotion of patriotism is desired. A
timely lesson strongly enforced.</p>
